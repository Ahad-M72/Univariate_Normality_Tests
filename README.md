# Univariate_Normality_Testss
Many parametric tests in statistical software require normality as a crucial assumption. Here is the code for the Python environment to conduct normality tests, including measures of skewness and kurtosis, and the coefficient of variation for univariate normality tests.
# CSV Coefficient of Variation Calculator

These script calculates the coefficient of variation (CV), Skewness and Kurtosis for each numeric column in a given CSV file. 

## Features

- Calculates mean, sample standard deviation, and CV for numeric columns.
- Handles non-numeric data gracefully.
- Modular and reusable functions.

## Usage

1. Place your CSV file in an accessible location.
2. Modify the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your CSV file.
3. Run the script.

# CSV Skewness and Kurtosis Calculator

This script calculates the skewness and kurtosis for all numeric columns in a given CSV file.


## Features

- Reads data from a CSV file
- Calculates mean, sample standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis for all numeric columns
- Modular and reusable functions

## Usage

1. Place your CSV file in an accessible location.
2. Modify the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your CSV file.
3. Run the script.

```bash
python CV.py
python Skewness and Kurtosis.py
