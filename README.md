# Univariate_Normality_Testss
Many parametric tests in statistical software require normality as a crucial assumption. Here is the code for the Python environment to conduct normality tests, including measures of skewness and kurtosis, and the coefficient of variation for univariate normality tests.
# CSV Coefficient of Variation Calculator

This script calculates the coefficient of variation (CV) for each numeric column in a given CSV file. 

## Features

- Calculates mean, sample standard deviation, and CV for numeric columns.
- Handles non-numeric data gracefully.
- Modular and reusable functions.

## Usage

1. Place your CSV file in an accessible location.
2. Modify the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your CSV file.
3. Run the script.

```bash
python cv.py
